Time Period: Medieval

Plot: A normal world in a medieval time period starts getting flooded with supernatural and mythical creatures, monsters, and other occurrences. The world becomes more dangerous, but in the process humanity uses these events for innovation and to fight back against the evil and other supernatural enemies that are showing up. A dungeon that tunnels deep into the ground is discovered and is said to be the source of the supernatural occurrences. It is also said to hold great treasure. Unknown to humanity, the dungeon is home to an army of demons ruled by the demon lord Rolgorath. The demons and this dungeon were once in another dimension, but Rolgorath transported their home and army to the same dimension as humans. When Rolgorath crossed dimensions, the barrier between them became weaker. This is the cause of the supernatural merging into this world.
